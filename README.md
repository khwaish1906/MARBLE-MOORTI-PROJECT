# MARBLE-MOORTI-PROJECT
A Marble Moorti Project involves designing, carving, and selling marble statues (moortis) of deities, saints, and other figures. It includes sourcing high-quality marble, employing skilled artisans for handcrafting, and marketing the finished sculptures to temples, homes, and international buyers. The project can range from small idols to large custom sculptures and may incorporate traditional and modern designs. Key aspects include raw material procurement, sculpting, polishing, quality control, and distribution. Success depends on craftsmanship, demand, and market reach.
